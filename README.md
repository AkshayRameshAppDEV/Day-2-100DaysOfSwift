Day 2 of 100 Days of Swift.

# Day 2

## Learnt the following:

1. Arrays
  - Ordered and can contain duplicates.
  - Linear Lookup: If you want to search for an element in Array, it goes through each element and checks if the element matches the required element.
  - Type Annotation and Type Inference
  - Zero Based
  - Can be accessed via positions
  - Array out of bounds exception if accessed position # > array length
  
2. Sets
  - No particular order and elements in set in unique (appear's only once).
  - Even if the array elements are repeated - It will appear only once in output
  - Set is Unordered and cannot contain duplicates
  - Random lookup - if you want to search an element in the array (Fast access)
  
3. Tuples
  - stores n values of different types together in a single variable
  - CANT add or remove items in tuple - Once created that's the fixed
  - CAN access values from tuple via the name or number position - zero based
  - CAN edit values of the created tuple only of the same type
  - In simple words - Tuples are array with names - Can be accessed via names/numbers
  - Key should be plain english Identifiers, Values can be any type
  - or comma separated of values of same type enclosed within parenthesis
  
4. Dictionaries
  - Key Value pairs (Any type)
  - Fast retrieval - No order, access randomly
  - Type Annotation and Type inference
  - Supports default values, i.e If there is a value for that key use the value, if not use the default value provided otherwise nil if there is no default value.
 
 5. Can Create empty collections of Array, Sets and Dictionaries
 
 6. Enums
  - group of related values
  - RawValue - enum ordinals
  - can assign a rawValue to enum case, which can then be used to increment from then.
  - Enums can also have associated value, which gives context to enums.
